#### OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
#### LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together, and WANs are operating over the Internet.
#### MAC address
#### UDP and TCP Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, 
     it needs to actually enter the network device.
#### The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, 
     to check if other network devices are available on the network. The command ping uses ICMP to make sure that a network device 
     remains online or to troubleshoot issues on the network.
